## Overview of Project and Dataset
The project includes two sub projects of image classification. The dataset used is dataset of images of 90 categories of animals where each category has 60 images. 

## Sub Project 1: One vs Rest Classification
This includes applying a binary classification which can identify one category as target and left categories as rest category. It utilises a custom CNN Model of 8 layers for implementation. The model is evaluated based on the 3 fold cross validation technique. The average precision in 3 techniques is 96%, average recall is 92.6% and average validation accuracy is 60%.


## Sub Project 2: 5 Class Classification
This includes applying a 5 Class classification model where there are 5 categories and prediction needs to be dondataset of these categories. It utilises a custom CNN Model of 8 layers for implementation. The model is evaluated based on the 3 fold cross validation technique. The average precision in 3 techniques is 88.3%, average recall is 87% and average validation accuracy is 58.6%.
